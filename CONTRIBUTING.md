# How to contribute to django-sage-session
### Did you find a bug?
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of django-sage-session will generally not be accepted (read more about our rationales behind this decision).
### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
- Suggest your change in the <commiunity@sageteam.com> and start writing code.
- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
### Do you have questions about the source code?
- Ask any question about how to use django-sage-cache in the [sage team slack].

django-sage-session is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!
